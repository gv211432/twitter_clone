            *** Twitter Clone ***

This project is based on the specifications provided for the 
Capstone 2 project ie. Social Media App(Twitter Clone)

1. Speaking about its authentication, it is based on passport js,
jwt, and express session. This approach is a hybrid approach where
jwt token is stored as session string on client machine. This provides 
ease of access and sharing of jwt tokens instead of sharing in headers as 
authorization and bearer. These jwt are using public/private certificates 
and session is using session secrets.

2. Local database of mongodb is used for storing the data generated during 
the operation of this app. All secret data is mentioned in .env file. This 
.env file will also be upload to repo in last commit for ease of use.

3. Many db models are created for accessing the database through the mongoose.

4. Backend uses nodejs and other packages for handling the requests.

5. There are some rest files for checkig the working of apis. For using this
vscode rest extension must be installed. It is an easy and direct alternative 
of postman.

6. In the frontend, src folder contains all the unique source code for 
this project. This frontend is based on reactjs. Being a small project
there was no need for redux, however global context api was used for 
sharing data across the app.

7. Pages folder contains all the pages present on the screen, and all this
pages have their own components.

8. All the relevent comments are added where ever was necessary.
